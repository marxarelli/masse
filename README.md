# Massé

![masse logo](./assets/masse-256.png)

Massé is a [BuildKit frontend][buildkit-frontend] that allows users to express
complex container image build graphs in [CUE][cue]. It:

 1. Provides simple constructs for expressing how container images should be
    created, composed, and packaged.
 2. Provides composable build primitives based on BuildKit's [Low Level Build][llb]
    (LLB) API.
 3. Allows users to author and share their own reusable build definitions as
    [CUE][cue] modules.
 4. Supports multi-platform build targets.
 5. Supports Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and provenance metadata.

## Based on CUE

The schema and user defined configuration is [CUE][cue], an "open-source data
validation language and inference engine with its roots in logic programming."

As a JSON superset, CUE has nearly the same compactness of YAML but is a very
powerful language for schema definition, validation/constraints, and user
facing configuration. With CUE we can support composable user defined types
and module imports.

## Requirements

Massé requires:

 1. `buildkitd`
 2. A BuildKit client (`docker buildx`)

### `buildkitd`

Massé is a [BuildKit frontend][buildkit-frontend] and so it requires
`buildkitd` to be running and accessible. There are a few different ways to
make that happen.

#### Run `docker.io/moby/buildkit` yourself (recommended)

Because of some caveats with the Docker Engine option below, I recommend just
running `buildkitd` yourself. It's easy to do via either Docker or Podman.

Note that `buildkitd` must be run in privileged mode due its own
containerization of build-time processes. In a sense, you give it privileged
access so it can isolate its own worker processes.

```console
$ docker run -d --name buildkitd -p 1234:1234 --privileged \
  docker.io/moby/buildkit:latest --addr tcp://0.0.0.0:1234
```

#### Using Docker Engine

Docker Engine ships with a `buildkitd` embedded and uses it as the default
builder since version 23.0. If you have a recent version of Docker, you don't
have to install anything extra. Simply make sure that the following command
lists a `default` builder.

```console
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE        DRIVER/ENDPOINT          STATUS    BUILDKIT   PLATFORMS
default          docker
 \_ default       \_ default              running   v0.21.0    linux/amd64 (+3), linux/386
```

However, there is a caveat. Some BuildKit features (such as the `merge` op)
require Docker Engine to be using the `containerd` image store which is not
enabled by default. To continue with this option, enable the `containerd`
image store by following [the documentation][docker-engine-containerd].

If you're using Docker Desktop, the documentation is
[here][docker-desktop-containerd].

### A BuildKit client

I am considering whether it makes sense for Massé to have its own CLI for
building (and other housekeeping tasks), but for now I recommend just using
`docker buildx` (yes, even if you're running `buildkitd` via Podman) since it
is the canonical BuildKit client.

Ensure your `buildkitd` is available for use by `docker buildx`.

```console
$ docker buildx create --driver remote --name buildkitd --use tcp://0.0.0.0:1234
buildkitd
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE        DRIVER/ENDPOINT          STATUS    BUILDKIT   PLATFORMS
buildkitd*       remote
 \_ buildkitd0    \_ tcp://0.0.0.0:1234   running   v0.22.0    linux/amd64 (+3), linux/386
```

## Usage

You'll invoke Massé builds using `docker buildx build`. The basic workflow
looks like this.

 1. Create a new project or switch to an existing one.
 2. Write a build configuration file (e.g. `masse.cue`).
 3. Include a `cue.mod/module.cue` file relative to your config for Massé
    schema and module dependencies.
 4. Run `docker buildx build -f masse.cue --target {target} .` to build a
    target image.

## Examples

### Basic contrived example

Given a `cue.mod/module.cue` file like this...

```cue
module: "masse.example"
language: {
  version: "v0.13.0"
}
deps: {
  "github.com/marxarelli/masse@v1": {
    v:       "v1.8.0"
  }
}
```

...and a `masse.cue` file like this...

```cue
// syntax=marxarelli/masse:v1.9.0
package main

import (
  "github.com/marxarelli/masse"
)

masse.Config

chains: {
  hello: [
    { scratch: true },
    { file: { mkfile: "/hi", content: 'hello world\n' } }
  ]
}

targets: {
  hello: {
    build: "hello"
  }
}
```

Running the following will build a new image for the `hello` target and output
its contents to the given directory `./build`.

```console
$ docker buildx build -f masse.cue --target hello --output ./build .

## Concepts

### Build chains

Build processes are defined as independent chains of the overall build graph.
This is meant to strike a balance between flexibility in graph node definition
while improving readability/reasoning of the overall build graph.

```cue
chains: {
  repo: [
    { git: "https://my.example/repo.git" },
  ]

  source: [
    { scratch: true },
    { copy: ".", from: "repo" },
  ]

  toolchain: [
    { image: "docker-registry.wikimedia.org/golang1.19:1.19-1-20230730" },
    { apt.install & { #packages: [ "gcc", "git", "make" ] } },
  ]

  binaries: [
    { merge: ["source", "toolchain"] },
    { with: directory: "/src" },
    { copy: ".", from: "source" },
    { run: "make" },
  ]

  application: [
    { scratch: true },
    { copy: "my-compiled-program", from: "binaries" },
  ]
}
```

As you can see with `{ merge ["source", "toolchain"] }` and `{ copy: ".",
from: "source"}` above, dependency chains are referenced by name. Chain
references are resolved during compilation.

### Macros

We can combine CUE's [definition][cue-defs] and [embedding][cue-embeds]
constructs to support a standard library and user-defined macros.

For example, the typical `apt install` pattern that's repeated in so many
Dockerfiles across the internet can be achieved with the following definition.

```cue
package apt

#PackageName: "[a-z0-9][a-z0-9+\\.\\-]+"
#VersionSpec: "(?:[0-9]+:)?[0-9]+[a-zA-Z0-9\\.\\+\\-~]*"
#ReleaseName: "[a-zA-Z](?:[a-zA-Z0-9\\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?"

#Package: =~ "^\(#PackageName)(?:=\(#VersionSpec)|/\(#ReleaseName))?$"

install: {
  #packages: [#Package, ...#Package]
  {
    sh: "apt-get install -y"
    arguments: #packages
    options: [
      { env: { "DEBIAN_FRONTEND": "noninteractive" } },
      { cache: "/var/lib/apt", access: "locked" },
      { cache: "/var/cache/apt", access: "locked" },
    ]
  }
}
```

The macro can define its parameter as a CUE definition, provide validation
constraints. In CUE terminology each package name must "unify" with the regex
constrained string.

```cue
#Package: =~ "^\(#PackageName)(?:=\(#VersionSpec)|/\(#ReleaseName))?$"
```

The macro can "return" its resulting build operations (in this case a single
`{ sh: ... }`) using an embed. The use of this shared macro is simply a CUE
unification with the definition.

```cue
import (
  "wikimedia.org/dduvall/masse/schema/apt"
)

chains:
  go: [
    { image: "docker-registry.wikimedia.org/golang1.19:1.19-1-20230730" },
    apt.install & { #packages: [ "gcc", "git", "make" ] },
  ]
```

### Modules

Massé supports CUE module dependencies and will automatically load modules
from remote OCI registries when reading in your config.

Dependencies are declared via a standard [CUE module file][cue-mod-file]
(`cue.mod/module.cue`) relative to your config file.

```
module: "project.example"
language: {
	version: "v0.13.0"
}
deps: "github.com/marxarelli/masse-go@v1": v: "v1.0.3"
```

You can import packages from these dependencies in your config, and Massé will
download the module for you at build time.

```
package main

import (
  "github.com/marxarelli/masse-go/go"
)

chains: {
  project: [
    { local: "context", options: exclude: [".git"] },
  ]

  build [
    go.image & { #version: "1.24" },
    go.mod.download & { #from: "project" },
    { copy: ".", from: "project" },
    go.build & { #packages: "./cmd/app" },
  ]
}
```

By default, Massé looks for modules in the `registry.cue.works` OCI registry.
To change this behavior, you can pass a `CUE_REGISTRY` build argument to
`docker buildx` to instruct the CUE registry client to look in a different
registry for your modules.

```
$ docker buildx build --build-arg CUE_REGISTRY=registry.example/cuemodules ...
```

See the upstream [documentation on CUE modules][cue-mod-registry-env] for
details on how to use this environment variable.

### Registry authentication

Some registries require authentication. To use such registries, you must
provide credentials (typically in the form of a bearer token) via a BuildKit
secret as well as a build argument telling Massé what the name of the secret
is.

```
$ cue login
$ REGISTRY_AUTH="$(jq -r '.registries."registry.cue.works" | (.token_type + " " + .access_token)' ~/.config/cue/logins.json)" \
  docker buildx build \
    --build-arg CUE_REGISTRY_AUTH_SECRET.registry.cue.works=REGISTRY_AUTH \
    --secret id=REGISTRY_AUTH \
    -f examples/modules/masse.cue examples/modules
```

Note that the above is no longer required for the CUE module registry at
`registry.cue.works` as the CUE folks have enabled public access. However,
authentication may still be desirable to avoid rate limiting.

## TODOs

 * Write better user guides and reference documentation.
 * Organize macros into a stdlib and implement macros for most of
   [Blubber][blubber]'s higher level builder directives (npm, python, php,
   etc.).
 * Chains are currently referenced by name. While it is possible to adopt
   references by actual CUE references (e.g. `{ copy: "." from: chains.foo }`)
   this pattern encounters current performance limitations in the v2 CUE
   evaluator. The CUE folks are working on a v3 evaluator that may make this
   direct use of references possible in the future.
 * At the moment, environment variables are not substituted in command
   strings. Should they be?
